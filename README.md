# AI & ML Studies

Personal repository for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning learning, experiments, and projects.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a dedicated space for:
- Learning and experimenting with AI/ML concepts
- Implementing algorithms and models from scratch
- Working through tutorials and courses
- Building personal AI/ML projects
- Documenting insights and progress
