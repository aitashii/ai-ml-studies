# AI & ML Studies

Personal repository for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning learning, experiments, and projects.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a dedicated space for:
- Learning and experimenting with AI/ML concepts
- Implementing algorithms and models from scratch
- Working through tutorials and courses
- Building personal AI/ML projects
- Documenting insights and progress

## Getting Started

This is a personal learning repository. Content will be added progressively as I work through various AI/ML topics.

### Installation

To install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file contains all necessary Python dependencies for AI/ML studies.

## Topics of Interest

- Machine Learning fundamentals
- Deep Learning
- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Vision
- Reinforcement Learning
- MLOps and model deployment

## Resources

All learning resources are organized in the `resources/` directory:
- **Python Guides**: Comprehensive Polish-language Python tutorials covering basics, data types, operators, I/O, and style conventions
- **Networking**: IP address classes, subnetting, and network fundamentals
- **Introduction to Programming**: Complete course materials including 14 laboratory exercises and lecture PDFs
